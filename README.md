# snake-crawler - README

## Overview
This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the turtle module. The objective of the game is to navigate the snake to eat the food, which makes the snake grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or with itself. The game includes a scoring system to keep track of the player's score.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
The turtle module (usually included in standard Python distributions)

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Python website.
Make sure you have the necessary Python files: main.py, snake.py, food.py, and scoreboard.py.
## Files
main.py: The main script file containing the game logic.
snake.py: Contains the Snake class, which manages the snake's behavior.
food.py: Contains the Food class, which manages the food's behavior.
scoreboard.py: Contains the Scoreboard class, which manages the scoring system.

## Running the Game
1) Place all the necessary files (main.py, snake.py, food.py, scoreboard.py) in the same directory.
2) Run the main.py script using Python:
          python main.py
3) A window will pop up displaying the game area.
4) Use the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys to control the direction of the snake.
5) The game will keep running until the snake collides with the wall or itself. You can close the game window to exit.
